# Feature Flag Service

## Stack

- Using dotnet 9 with C#
- RESTful API
- DataBase to be defined

## Out of Scope
* Front-end app to interact with the APIs (ANgular/React)
* Api filtering, filter by user, by creation date
* Implement a chache to avoid repetitive calls
* Api pagination, to avoid in the future get all the information created from the beginning
* Integration tests
* User autentication to get the user identity
* Client app to show the real use of the system
* Dockerization of the app

## Develop Enviroment and tools

* Visual Studio Code
* Ubuntu
* Postman

## GitHub Copilot
To speed up the development. Used mainly to create class bodies, example:
```
Create a FeatureToggle class with name, description, developerOwner, creation date
Create audit class with Action,Detail,flagId,dateTime,byUser.
create a class named :UpdatePartiallyRequest
```
Then copy/paste to have control of my code.
